Tic Tac Toe
=========
## Introduction

This Tic Tac Toe Project is a 3x3 game. The goal of this project was to create a Tic-Tac-Toe board which is able to monitor the state of a game and return the win/loose/draw state of the game after each player’s move. Specifically, for each player’s turn, the game records the player’s inputs and at the end of the game determines if the game is done and who the winner is and record the score. The game allows two players to play against each other. Each of the nine spaces can be “X”, “O” or blank.
